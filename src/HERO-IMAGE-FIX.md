# Hero Image Desktop Fix

## ‚úÖ Problem Solved

The desktop hero section now uses the custom hero image instead of the 3-mockup layout.

## üîß Changes Made

### 1. Removed Mobile-Only Restriction
**Before**: Hero image only showed on mobile/tablet (`lg:hidden`)
**After**: Hero image shows on all screen sizes (removed `lg:hidden` class)

### 2. Removed Desktop Mockups
- Eliminated the 3-overlapping mockup layout for desktop
- Removed unused transform variables (`mockup1Y`, `mockup2Y`, `mockup3Y`)
- Simplified the hero section to use single image approach

### 3. Updated Documentation
- Updated `IMAGE-REQUIREMENTS.md` to reflect single hero image for all devices
- Removed references to optional desktop mockups
- Clarified that hero image should work well on both mobile and desktop

## üé® Result

Now the hero section displays:
- **Single hero image** with parallax effect on all devices
- **Consistent experience** across mobile, tablet, and desktop
- **Beautiful fallback placeholder** when image is missing
- **Responsive scaling** that works well on all screen sizes

## üìÅ Required Image

You only need **one hero image**:
- `hero-image.png` - Works for all screen sizes (1170 x 2532px recommended)

The image will automatically scale and maintain its aspect ratio across all devices while providing the parallax scrolling effect.
